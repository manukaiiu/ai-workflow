# Progress Log: Bootstrap Project-Root Structure

## 2026-01-14 - Session 1

### Completed
- Created work item structure (00-OVERVIEW, 01-SCOPE, 02-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN)
- Defined scope and phased approach
- Ready to begin Phase 1: Artifact Analysis

### Notes
- The `2-knowledge/` folder currently has PHASE-*.md files from old structure
- These are historical development docs, may need reorganization
- User has external .md files to integrate (location TBD)
