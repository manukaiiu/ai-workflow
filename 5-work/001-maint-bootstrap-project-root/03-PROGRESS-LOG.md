# Progress Log: Bootstrap Project-Root Structure

## 2026-01-14 - Session 1

### Completed
- Created work item structure (00-OVERVIEW, 01-SCOPE, 02-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN)
- Defined scope and phased approach
- Ready to begin Phase 1: Artifact Analysis

### Notes
- The `2-knowledge/` folder currently has PHASE-*.md files from old structure
- These are historical development docs, may need reorganization
- User has external .md files to integrate (location TBD)

## 2026-01-14 - Session 1 (continued)

### Completed
- **Phase 1: Artifact Analysis** - Read and analyzed:

  - MODE.md (dual-mode operation, path resolution)
  - FOR-HUMANS.md (user guide, best practices)
  - Surveyed protocols/ (23 protocol files)
  - Surveyed reference/ (6 reference docs)
  - Surveyed templates/ (34 template files)
  - Read GLOSSARY.md and ANTI-PATTERNS.md in detail

- **Phase 2: Concept Extraction** - Created:
  - `1-concepts/ai-workflow-system/CONCEPT.md`
  - Documented: philosophy, core abstractions, design decisions, success metrics

- **Phase 3: Knowledge Base** (partial) - Created:
  - `2-knowledge/architecture.md` - system architecture and component relationships
  - `2-knowledge/design-decisions.md` - key decisions and rationale
  - `2-knowledge/glossary.md` - project-specific terminology

### In Progress
- Phase 4: Workplan structure
- Phase 5: External file collection (waiting for user input)

### Next
- Create workplan structure in `4-workplans/`
- User to provide paths to external .md files for integration
