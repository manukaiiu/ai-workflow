# Work Item Overview: Bootstrap Project-Root Structure

**Type**: Maintenance
**Status**: In Progress
**Created**: 2026-01-14

## Quick Context

The ai-workflow project-root was created during restructure, but the numbered folders only contain copied-over files from the old structure. This work item properly bootstraps the project with:

1. **Concept** derived from actual analysis of the ai-workflow artifact
2. **Knowledge base** documenting the system architecture and design decisions
3. **Workplan** structure for tracking future improvements
4. **Work items** translated from scattered .md files on disk

## Current Phase

Phase 1: Scope Definition & Analysis

## Scope

### In Scope

- Analyze `6-instances/main/ai-workflow/` artifact to extract the core concept
- Create proper concept documentation in `1-concepts/`
- Build knowledge base in `2-knowledge/` (architecture, design decisions, glossary)
- Set up workplan structure in `4-workplans/`
- Collect external .md files with feature requests/improvements
- Translate collected items into work items or workplan entries

### Out of Scope

- Actually implementing improvements to ai-workflow (separate work items)
- Changes to the artifact itself (this is about the project-root, not the product)

## File Index

| File | Type | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| 00-OVERVIEW.md | Core | This file - status and navigation |
| 01-SCOPE.md | Core | Detailed scope definition |
| 02-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md | Core | Phased approach |
| 03-PROGRESS-LOG.md | Core | Session log |

## Next Actions

1. Define detailed scope in 01-SCOPE.md
2. Create implementation plan
3. Begin artifact analysis
