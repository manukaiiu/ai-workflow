# Scope: Bootstrap Project-Root Structure

## Objective

Transform the ai-workflow project-root from a skeleton with copied files into a properly structured project with derived concepts, curated knowledge, and actionable workplans.

## Deliverables

### 1. Concept Documentation (`1-concepts/`)

Create a concept document that captures:
- What ai-workflow IS (purpose, philosophy)
- Core abstractions (work types, protocols, knowledge system)
- Design principles (hierarchical loading, SSOT, append-only)
- The dual-mode operation model

This should be **derived from analyzing the artifact**, not copied from existing docs.

### 2. Knowledge Base (`2-knowledge/`)

Organize into:
- `architecture.md` - System architecture and component relationships
- `design-decisions.md` - Why things are the way they are
- `glossary.md` - Key terms and their meanings
- Historical docs (PHASE-*.md) - Keep as reference, potentially reorganize

### 3. Workplan Structure (`4-workplans/`)

Create a structure for tracking:
- Feature requests
- Improvement ideas
- Technical debt items
- Documentation gaps

### 4. Collected Work Items (`5-work/` or `3-inbox/`)

- Gather .md files from user's disk
- Triage into: immediate work items vs future backlog
- Translate into proper format

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `1-concepts/` has a coherent concept document derived from artifact analysis
- [ ] `2-knowledge/` has organized, useful documentation
- [ ] `4-workplans/` has a structure ready to receive feature requests
- [ ] External .md files are triaged and integrated
- [ ] Old copied files are either reorganized or archived

## Compatibility

No compatibility concerns - this is purely organizational work on the project-root level.
