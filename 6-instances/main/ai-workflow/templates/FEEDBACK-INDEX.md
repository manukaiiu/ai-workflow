# Meta-Feedback Index

Learnings and improvement ideas about the **workflow system itself** (not the project being developed).

Use `>>feedback` command to add new entries.

## How to Use

**Quick feedback** (human): Create `FB-NNN-short-name.md` with freeform notes
**Structured feedback** (agent-assisted): Use template from `templates/FEEDBACK.md`

## Naming Convention

`FB-NNN-short-name.md` where:
- `FB` = Feedback prefix
- `NNN` = Sequential number (001, 002, ...)
- `short-name` = Brief descriptive slug

## Feedback Status

| Status | Meaning |

| Declined | Considered but not adopted (with reason) |
